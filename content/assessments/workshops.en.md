You are expected to bring a laptop to this session that you use for your studies. Please read the schools [Technology and equipment](https://teaching.maths.ed.ac.uk/main/undergraduate/studies/equipment) page for information on equipment or to request a device. There is also a [loan service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/library-museum-gallery/using-library/borrowing-a-book/borrowing-laptops) in the main library if anything is wrong with your device at short notice.

During these sessions you will work in teams on computing lab exercises and you will finish the exercises after the workshop and turn in your lab reports by Tuesday 4pm UK time. Marking will be binary, with any reasonable attempt to complete the worksheet receiving full credit. No extensions will be granted for submitting these worksheets and solutions will be provided after the deadline. Workshop submissions with the lowest score for each student will be dropped.

Set up weekly team meetings between Friday and Tuesday.

You will be asked to form teams of 3 or 4 students based on your pre-arranged workshop timeslot and room assignment. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark.

Students are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member’s relative contribution for each workshop submission.

To take part in workshops you will need to first setup your GitHub and RStudio Cloud accounts. Instructions to do this are given in the <a id="troubleshoot">Setup & Troubleshooting</a> page.

A frequently asked question is “What happens if I can’t make it to a workshop one week because I’m sick or have another obligation at that time?” Answers below:

- First, if you have another obligation every week at the time of your workshop, you should change into another group (workshops are held at three separate hours on Friday, pick a time slot that works for your schedule.) If you can’t make any of the times of the workshops, you should drop this class.
- Chances are you asked this question because you’re only missing one or two workshops throughout the semester:
  - If you’re missing a workshop day due to short-term illness or some other reason, you should communicate this with your team and attend a team meeting before the deadline for the assignment to contribute to the teamwork. If you have made 0 commits towards a lab assignment, you will receive a 0 for that assignment, so you need to participate both for being a team player and also for your own individual score.
  - If you’re unable to contribute to a lab assignment because of an illness taking you away from school work for an extended period of time, you should let your team know that you won’t be able to contribute to that lab and either make this your dropped lab score or apply for special circumstances.
  
Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each other's time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class once or twice.
