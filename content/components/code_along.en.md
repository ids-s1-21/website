title: Code Along Sessions
weight: 3

These will be held on Thursdays on [Zoom](https://example.com), and they will be recorded and posted in their respective week page. These live coding sessions are yet another opportunity to ask questions. Theyâ€™re also a good time to learn about workflow and debugging techniques since there will inevitably be lots wrinkles to iron out during unstructured live coding.
