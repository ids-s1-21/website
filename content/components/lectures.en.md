These pre-recorded videos are released on Mondays and are comprised of course content and weekly "State of the IDS" videos (recap of previous week, what’s coming in the new week, frequently asked questions). You’re expected to watch (and learn from) them before Friday’s workshops. To keep your learning active, you’ll have the chance to work on application exercises that you can complete on <a id="RStudioCloud">RStudio Cloud</a>[RStudio Cloud].
