The course organisers will each hold "student hours" from week 2 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Student hours are a chance for you to ask your questions "live" to the course organisers. Attendance is optional.

Please indicate on the <a id="survey1"> Getting to Know you Survey</a> when would be a convenient time for us to hold these. We will announce the times at the beginning of week 2. Currently the default times are Tuesday 12:10 - 13:00 and Wednesday 10:00 - 10:50, but if enough student request another time we can move them.

Tuesdays session will be held on Zoom and Wednesdays will be held in-person at Office 2257, James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's Buildings Campus. Both sessions will not be recorded. Itâ€™s a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!
