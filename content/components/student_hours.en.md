The course organisers will each hold "student hours" from week 2 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Student hours are a chance for you to ask your questions "live" (or just say hi) to the course organisers. Attendance is optional and you can turn up at any time during the hour.

Tuesdays session (12:10 - 13:00) will be held on Zoom and Wednesdays (10:00 - 10:50) will be held in-person at Office 2257, James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's Buildings Campus. Both sessions will not be recorded.
