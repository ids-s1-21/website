The course organisers will each hold student hours twice a week from week 2, once on Tuesdays (TBA) and one on Wednesdays (TBA). Please indicate on the <a id="survey1"> Getting to Know you Survey</a> when would be a convenient time for us to hold these. We will announce the times at the beginning of week 2.

Tuesdays session will be held in-person at [INSERT PLACE], and Wednesdays will be held on __Zoom__ and will not be recorded. Itâ€™s a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!
