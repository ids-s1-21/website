The course organisers will each hold student hours from week 2 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Please indicate on the <a id="survey1"> Getting to Know you Survey</a> when would be a convenient time for us to hold these. We will announce the times at the beginning of week 2.

Tuesdays session will be held on Zoom and Wednesdays will be held in-person at Office 2257, James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's Buildings Campus. Both sessions will not be recorded. Itâ€™s a great time to come and get real time answers to your questions or just say hi!
