title: Help
---

Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Piazza:** The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on Piazza. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. When you post a question on Piazza, you can choose to do so anonymously to your classmates. Note that the course instructors and tutors can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you're providing great answers to others' questions! Piazza will be available soon!
- **Teams:** We will use Teams for synchronous course communication. Feel free to post questions you need short and quick answers to there. Note that while Teams is great for quick clarifications, it's not a great venue for lengthy questions that require extended discussion.  
- **Student hours:** Course organisers will hold students hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays in person and on Zoom. Please feel free to call in with any questions, or just to say hi!
- **MathsBase:** MathsBase is our drop-in support centre which allows you to talk to a tutor about most of our year 1 and year 2 courses in Mathematics. [Normally this would operate on-campus, but this year we will be operating it online.] MathsBase will offer synchronous support for courses, the tutors which staff it will usually be available to help between 9am and 6pm Monday to Friday. You’re welcome to join at any time to discuss questions you have on the course material, both with classmates and with the tutor. To access MathsBase [you should find you are already added to the MathsBase team on Microsoft Teams - and this is where you can access the MathsBase support.]

  [Make sure you can share screen or a photo of the problem you are working on.
  Find the ‘General’ channel of the MathsBase team and read the welcome message.
  Reply to that message with a note of which course you are wanting help with.
  Go to the course channel for that course and join or start a meeting to wait for the tutor. Whilst you are there you can talk to other students from the course who might also be waiting too. You might find that others have similar questions.]

- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Piazza or Teams), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, concessions).

- For more general support and advice, please make use of the following resources:
  <ul>
    <li>Your personal tutor (especially if you are struggling in general).</li>
    <li>Student learning advisor for the course.</li>
    <li><a = id="IAD">Institute for Academic Development</a>: Online events and support.</li>
    <li><a = id="Advice">The Advice Place</a>: Open for phone and email advice.</li>
    <li><a = id="Disability">Student Disability Service</a>.</li>
  </ul>

Make good use of this support system, it is there for you! And if you're not sure where to go for help, just ask any academic or administrative member of the course team.
