    <p style= "text-align: left; font-size: 1.2vw; overflow:hidden;"><em>My pronouns are he/him.</em> I am a University Teacher in Mathematical Sciences Computing in the School of Mathematics. My work focuses on teaching probability, statistics, and data science to undergraduate and master’s students; with previous experience teaching hypothesis testing and research design. My recent research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to improve the diagnosis speed and accuracy of identifying seizures in clinical records of electrical brain activity. Alike to many data scientists from a neuroscience background, I appreciate how human neurology and behaviour has inspired many modern machine learning advancements. I am passionate about the practical applications of machine learning and aim to educate and inspire others to develop research and models to tackle real-world challenges.</p>

<em>My pronouns are she/her.</em> I am an Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University as well as a Professional Educator and Data Scientist at RStudio. My work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM. I work on integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. I also organize ASA DataFest, an annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set. I also work on the OpenIntro project, whose mission is to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education. As part of this project I co-authored three open-source introductory statistics textbooks. I am also the creator and maintainer of datasciencebox.org and I teach the popular Statistics with R MOOC on Coursera.
