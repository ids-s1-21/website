### Zoom expectations

- When in a large session you should,
  - have your microphone muted by default
  - use the raise your hand feature or type in the chat for questions and comments

- In the small team sessions you should,
  - have your camera turned on as much as possible
  - engage with your team mates via voice and text chat
  - take turns sharing your screen when necessary

### Collaboration policy

Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively. Individual assignments must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the instructors and tutors. You are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

### Sharing / reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

### Academic integrity

The University takes academic misconduct very seriously and is committed to ensuring that so far as possible it is detected and dealt with appropriately. Find out more about the University's official policies around academic misconduct <a id="misconduct">here</a>.

Cheating or plagiarising on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate the University policies, and will not be tolerated. Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the School Academic Misconduct Office.

### Late work, extensions, and special circumstances

All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow us (the course staff) to return marks and feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time. Note, first of all, that we drop the lowest score of quizzes, labs, and homework assignments. So if you miss one assignment, this can be your dropped score. 

- **Late work policy:** Some assignments cannot be turned in late and some assignments can be turned in past the deadline with a late penalty:
  - Quizzes: No late work accepted
  - Labs: No late work accepted
  - Homework assignments: Late work accepted up to 4 days past the deadline (i.e. Monday after the deadline, 16:00 UK time), with 5% penalty for each day
  - Project proposal: Late work accepted up to 4 days past the deadline (i.e. Monday after the deadline, 16:00 UK time), with 5% penalty for each day
  - Project re-proposal: No late work accepted (this is an optional assignment)
  - Project: No late work accepted for the presentation, late work accepted for the write-up up to 7 days after the deadline, with 5% penalty for each dat

Please review the official University and School policies <a id="extensions">here</a>. If you intend to submit work late for the project, you must **notify the course organizer** before the original deadline as well as as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub.

- **Extensions:** The University has an extension policy whereby you can request an extension for any assignments where late work is accepted. If your extension request is approved, you can turn in the assignment late and not incur the late penalty. As outlined above you can request an extension for homework assignments, the project proposal, and the project write up. Extensions are not granted for quizzes, labs, project re-proposal, and project presentation under any circumstances. To request an extension you must visit the <a id="extensionsExplained">Extensions and Special Circumstances website</a> and *Apply for an extension* there. A decision will be made within 2 days and the team will notify the student of their decision. Note that decisions are made by an external committee, not the course teaching staff, so requests for extensions must go through this form and not through course organisers and tutors. 

- **Special circumstances:** You can think of special circumstances as one level above an extension request, where there is a documented reason why you're unable to complete any assignment in the course. Special circumstances decisions are made at the end of the semester by an external committee. To request a special circumstances waiver you must visit the <a id="specialCircumstancesExplained">Extensions and Special Circumstances website</a> and *Apply for special circumstances* there. 

If you're not sure whether your personal circumstance should be filed under an extension or special circumstances, we recommend you reach out to your Personal Tutor and/or Student Support Officers (<a id="StudentSupportMail">studentsupport@maths.ed.ac.uk</a>).

### Regrade requests 

Regrade requests must be made within one week of when the assignment is returned, and must be typed up and submitted via email to David Elliott (<a id="MailDavid">david.elliott@ed.ac.uk</a>). These will be honoured if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel your answer is correct but it was marked wrong. No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for a mistake. There will be no grade changes after the final project presentations.

### Diversity & inclusion

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official University of Edinburgh records, please let me know!
- Please let me know your preferred pronouns.
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your personal tutor is an excellent resource.
- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Learning during a pandemic

I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

- You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I canâ€™t help, I likely know someone who can.

- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.

*Note:* If you've read this far in the syllabus, email me a puppy or kitten picture! Could be yours, or one you found online.
