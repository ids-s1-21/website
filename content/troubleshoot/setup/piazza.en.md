The best way to get any questions answered in a timely manner on course content, technology, logistics, and policies is to post your question on <a id="Piazza">Piazza</a>. Piazza is designed to connect students, TAs, and professors so you can get help when you need it. A good place to start setting up and learning about Piazza is the following _introduction for students_ video:

When you are on the course page, you will see questions and their answers in the "Q & A" tab. How questions are structured is discussed in the following video (its directed at instructors but is useful to know as a student too!):

### Post a Question

Before creating a Piazza post, if your issue is to do with some error you are getting in R, your probably best starting with [Google](https://www.google.com/) or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). If you donâ€™t find anything useful there, then prepare a minimal reproducible example to post on Piazza.

Some great advice about what to do when you get stuck when learning R can be found [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#getting-help-and-learning-more).

To post a new question in Piazza, use the __New Post__ button in the top left hand corner (see the following [post a question](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000574396-students-post-a-question) page for details). You can restrict your post so only the instructors or students in your team can see it (see the [group post](https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000616721-post-to-your-group) page). You should restrict your post if it contains specific details of your answer for an assessed bit of work (a general question is fine to ask everyone). When you post a question on Piazza, you can also choose to do so anonymously.
