### I keep getting stuck in the waiting room and/or have "guest" next to my name
This occurs because your Zoom account is not setup properly with your University Email: 

- Go to [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download) and download the latest __Zoom Client for Meetings__ and install it.

- Once logged in go to the __Settings__ (see [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362623-Changing-settings-in-the-desktop-client-or-mobile-app) for details where to find it).

- In Settings, __test__ your __audio__ (mic and speaker) and __video__.
- Also in Settings, click on __Profile__ and make sure it says _"Single Sign On"_ under your name.

If there is no “Single Sign On” under your profile, please log out and log back in with your university account (see [here](https://ids-s1-20.github.io/slides/week-01/w1-d04-toolkit-course/w1-d04-toolkit-course.html#6) for instructions).

- If you are unable to turn on your camera during sessions, please add a photo to your profile. 
- Make sure your name shows up as the preferred name you indicated on the course survey.

### I can't share my screen

This sometimes occurs when different users are using different versions of Zoom. To rectify this make sure everyone is using the latest version of Zoom:

- Make sure you are using the __Zoom Client for Meetings__ (see above).
- Click your profile picture then click _Check for Updates_.
